# **Game**

## **Introduction**  
This is a multi-level challenge game designed to test your skills and strategy as you tackle progressively harder stages. With unique gameplay mechanics and a clean graphical interface, the game offers an exciting experience for all players. Are you ready to **try and win more than [X] levels?**  

## **Challenge**  
**Try and win more than 3 levels!** I’ll be waiting for your screenshots to see how far you can go. Send your best attempts to **tejas_@codeday.org** — let’s see if you can beat my expectations!  

## **Disclaimer**  
This code is a personal project crafted with dedication. While the core logic and design are my own, I’ve taken the help of AI tools for correcting logical errors and refining the GUI to enhance the overall user experience.

## [Update] Repository Restored

Sorry for the inconvenience caused. Due to an issue, all the repositories were deleted.

As of **6th December 2024**, I have re-uploaded all the code. Thank you for your understanding!
